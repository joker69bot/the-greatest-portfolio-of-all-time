        <h3>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to come up with an entire paragraph of random
            text that seems somewhat interesting? Thanks to my current predicament, I can certainly tell you one
            thing: it's hard. I'm tempted to copy/paste the entirety of the introductory MLA template paragraph in
            Google Docs, which would certainly put a damper on how cohesive this project is, but it would probably be
            more interesting than anything I've typed in this blob of nothingness.

                He'd probably be decent at making a Godot game, but he spends most of his time on Piskel anyway!
                Because his previous sprites were so terrible, considering one consisted of a black outline and
                "shading" to make up a creative interpretation of a mountain, he decided to double down during 
                his Cookie Clicker project and focus on making them look decent instead of working on the game 
                itself! Even then, the lighting of his sprites seem to come from every single angle. What is this, 
                heaven? Either way, at least the game works well enough to be considered playable, a significant
                step forward in the hilariously buggy mess comprised of previous works.

            <p>Electrical engineering is nice and all, but it seems that after coming back to Code Central
                following the entire lockdown shtick, he hasn't done a single Arduino project since. Due to the fact
                that no prior projects were saved, instead you get another chance of playing "Where In The World Is 
                The Lighting Coming From?" this time with a Snake clone! Admittedly, it took a bit more effort to do, 
                since he decided to be an idiot and make directional sprites, meaning that if he wanted to make it 
                seem slightly less janky, contrary to its true nature, he would have to spend way too much time trying 
                to figure out how to store directions for each part of the snake's body. Can you believe that he was 
                even planning to make sprites for turning, too?

            <p>After doing games for an extended period of time, he forgot how to set up an HTML file! It was a
                struggle to even create this website, so thanks for not reviewing anything like a stubborn fool! 
                Even with previous works, like the showcased Business Website it seems he was mainly focused on 
                style over substance, evident by the fact that none of the links in the navbar go anywhere. Even 
                then, it still just looks like a grey miasma plaguing your eyeballs as you wonder what phase he 
                was in when this was made, edgy or anime?
